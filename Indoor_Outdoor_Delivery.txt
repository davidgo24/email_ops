Hello {first_last_name},

[insert dates here]



Please Note: 

*An Adult 18+ is required to receive delivery for Indoor Drop Off. If no authorized adult is present during your scheduled delivery window for Indoor Drop Off, your delivery may automatically be changed to Outdoor Drop Off by Living Spaces (or if Living Spaces does not change your delivery to Outdoor Drop Off, you will be charged a delivery fee to reschedule).

Please keep in mind windows do fill up quickly, so it is important to respond at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
